# Blockify

Blockify began as Controlify, with only the ability to control songs on spotify and other media players, but that name was taken! So Blockify was the next thought that came to mind, but I would need to "ad" a feature for that, something needed blocking... 
Blockify is your spotify controller that also blocks Spotify ads!
Sadly this relies on an ever-evolving application that wants their users to hear these ads... so this feature may stop working in the future. 

There are 3 versions that come packaged together: 
Blockify     
Blockify - Mini  
Blockify - TopMost 

Blockify was the original application developed, with the others coming out from features requested. It is a movable banner that you can minimize.

Blockify Mini was requested cause the original was quite long.. So this ones a bit more compact.

Blockify TopMost was requested for those that wanted a bar to control spotify without switching applications.
